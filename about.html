    <h3>About the Leage of Nations Armaments Yearbook</h3>
<div class="container">
    <p>

        The Nortwestern University Library in Evanston, IL was one of 
        several depositories that received documents published by the League of Nations.
        Sometime in the 1990s, the Preservation Department digitized the 
        collection and made them available to view and download as PDF documents 
        for anyone with an Internet connection.
    </p>

    <p>When NWU's League of Nations website was first constructed in the late 90s, download times were very slow. 
        The digital version of the Armaments Year Books
        was split into several pieces. 
        There are other documents avaiable from the site,
        but most are smaller then the Armaments Year Books.
        Fortunately, a decision was made to split the Year Books into logical units: in this case, chapters of the documents.
        Each Year Book has a title page and a brief introduction, 
        a chapter for each nation, and one to several chapters of axillary information in the back of the book.

        Unfortunately, however, the search and browse interface at NWUs site does not make it easy to make 
        easy to access the Armaments Yearbooks or it's parts.
        This site corrects that problem by placing the chapters in a table.
        Click on each icon to download the PDF file for each chapter.
