    <h3>About the League of Nations Armaments Yearbook</h3>
    <p>
        The League of Nations was an international organization created 
        after World War I to provide a forum for resolving international disputes.
        One of the duties was to gather and publish data from member nations (and a few non-member nations) with 
        the ultimate aim of preventing conflict. One of the primary publications 
        was the Armaments Year Books. The yearbooks and other publications were distributed to various depositories throughout the world.

    <h3>About this site (technical details)</h3>
    <p>

            The <a href="https://www.library.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University Library</a> in Evanston, IL was one of 
            several depositories that received documents published by the League of Nations.
            Sometime in the 1990s, the library digitized the 
            collection and made them available to view and download as PDF documents 
            for anyone with an Internet connection 
            through a <a href="http://digital.library.northwestern.edu/league/">League of Nations Statistical and Disarmament Documents portal</a>.
        </p>
    
        <p>When NWU's League of Nations website was first created in the late 90s, download times were very slow. 
            The digital version of the Armaments Year Books
            was split into several pieces. 
            There are other documents available from the site,
            but most are smaller than the Armaments Year Books.
            Fortunately, a decision was made to split the yearbooks into logical units: in this case, chapters of the documents.
            Each Year Book has a title page and a brief introduction, 
            a chapter for each nation, and one to several chapters of supplementary information in the back of the book.

            Unfortunately, however, the search and browse interface at NWUs site, howerver, does not do justice to the Armaments Year Books 
            Accessing the yearbooks or it's parts is difficult through the search portal.
            This site corrects that problem by placing the chapters in a table.
            Click on each icon to download the PDF file for each chapter.
